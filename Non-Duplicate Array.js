// You have been provided with two arrays your task is to merge both arrays while removing the duplicate elements from the merged array.

// Expected Input
//  arr1= [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
//  arr2 = [5,6,7,8,9]
// Expected Output
// [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
// Note
// The order of the elements should be preserved, i.e., The elements of the final array should be in the same order as they were present in the merging array.
// Test Cases
// Merge arr1 and arr2
// Find all the duplicate elements from the new array and keep the order of the elements the same
// Return the new array


arr1 = [1,2,4,5,7];
arr2 = [3,4,6,7,9,0];
function mergeArray(arr1,arr2){
    const mergedSet = new Set([...arr1, ...arr2]);
    const uniqueArray = Array.from(mergedSet);
    
    return uniqueArray;
}
console.log(mergeArray(arr1,arr2));
